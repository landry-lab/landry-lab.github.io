We seek to answer questions like, How do groups change the way that information and diseases spread? How does the size of a group change the probability that its members will change their minds? How do groups form? Can we effective mitigate diseases if we understand the underlying connection patterns? We use tools from network science, mathematical modeling, Bayesian inference, and open-source development to help answer these questions."

    "text": "Pairwise and higher-order network structure\n\nComplex systems, which model a collection of entities and their interactions, can be represented using several different mathematical objects. One common representation is a pairwise network where one assumes that only two entities may interact at once. Many empirical systems, however, often contain interactions between an arbitrary number of entities, also known as higher-order interactions. Higher-order networks, also known as hypergraphs, can model these higher-order interactions and can thus more accurately capture the structure, and potentially the dynamics, of these systems. We study the structure of these social systems and attempt to measure and model them in meaningful ways.\nReferences:\n\nThe simpliciality of higher-order networks\nFiltering higher-order datasets"

For example, time-series data derived from contagion processes can uncover underlying connection patterns by determining which links best explain the system’s state transitions. We use Bayesian inference to reconstruct networks from all kinds of data: mobility, time-series, contact tracing, and survey data.\n\nReconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions"

    "text": "Our group helps maintain several software resources. These are essential infrastructure for our research.\n\nxgi\nThe CompleX Group Interactions (XGI) library provides data structures and algorithms for modeling and analyzing complex systems with group (higher-order) interactions.\nMany datasets can be represented as graphs, where pairs of entities (or nodes) are related via links (or edges). Examples are road networks, energy grids, social networks, neural networks, etc. However, in many other datasets, more than two entities can be related at a time. For example, many scientists (entities) can collaborate on a scientific article together (links), and multiple email accounts (entities) can all participate on the same email thread (links). In this latter case, graphs no longer present a viable alternative to represent such datasets. It is for this kind of datasets, where the interactions are given among groups of more than two entities (also called higher-order interactions), that XGI was designed for.\nXGI is implemented in pure Python and is designed to seamlessly interoperate with the rest of the Python scientific stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, etc). XGI is designed and developed by network scientists with the needs of network scientists in mind.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package\n    \nhypercontagion\nHyperContagion is a Python package for the simulation and visualization of contagion processes on complex systems with group (higher-order) interactions.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package"
