One common representation is a pairwise network where one assumes that only two entities may interact at once.

Higher-order networks, also known as hypergraphs, can model these higher-order interactions and can thus more accurately capture the structure, and potentially the dynamics, of these systems. We study the structure of these social systems and attempt to measure and model them in meaningful ways.\nReferences:\n\nThe simpliciality of higher-order networks\nFiltering higher-order datasets"

    "text": "Inferring network structure\nDetermining the structure of complex systems is inferential in nature; relationships between entities in that system are deduced from observational data such as paper co-authorship, proximity sensing, and contact tracing. For example, time-series data derived from contagion processes can uncover underlying connection patterns by determining which links best explain the system’s state transitions. We use a Bayesian framwork to reconstruct networks from all kinds of data: mobility, time-series, contact tracing, and survey data.\nReferences:\n\nComplex contagions can outperform simple contagions for network reconstruction with dense networks or saturated dynamics"
