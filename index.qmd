The Landry Lab at the University of Virginia studies how the structure of networks and groups affect the spread of diseases, information, and ideology.

I'm recruiting the following positions:

**Research Associate**: I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher to work on the following areas:

* Dynamical models: Developing realistic models for the spread of diseases and ideology on networks, particularly higher-order networks
* Bayesian Inference: Reconstructing networks and disease dynamics from imperfect and noisy observational data
* Higher-order network structure: Developing higher-order measures sensible for the spread of diseases and information
* Software development: Developing scientific Python software to support research and facilitate the dissemination of results
